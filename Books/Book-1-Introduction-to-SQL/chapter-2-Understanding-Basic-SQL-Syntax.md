# Chapter 2 - Understanding Basic SQL Syntax

## 2.1 The SQL Syntax

The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:

* **Clauses**, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)[17]
* **Expressions**, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data
* **Predicates**, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or 
  Boolean truth values and are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.
* **Queries**, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of SQL.
* **Statements**, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or may control transactions, program flow, 
  connections, sessions, or diagnostics.
* SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is 
  defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.
* Insignificant **whitespace** is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.
