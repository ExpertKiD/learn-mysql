# Chapter 1 - Introduction to SQL

##  1.1 Introduction

> Structured Query Language(SQL) is a special purpose programming language.

SQL (pronunced "sequel" or Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for
managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data 
stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations
among entities and variables.

SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query 
language (`DQL`),a data definition language (`DDL`), a data control language (`DCL`), and a data manipulation language (`DML`).
The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update and delete), data definition (schema creation and 
modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes 
procedural elements.

# 1.2 The Relational Model

The relational model is a model to describe the data and the relationships between data entities. The database stores data 
in `tables`. Each `table` has `columns`. Each 'column' has restrictions about the type of the data, the format of the data.
Columns can also be `required` or `not required`.

> **Database Design** is important; it controls the questions we can ask later.
> `SQL` is the language you use to ask those questions.

# 1.3 Summary

SQL is a powerful declarative language that you can grasp by understanding a few basic concepts.
